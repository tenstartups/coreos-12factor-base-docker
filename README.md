CoreOS Twelve-Factor Initialization
==

This project is a very opinionated set of procedures and scripts for running applications in CoreOS and Docker, with the fundamental aim of meeting the requirements of a twelve-factor application (http://12factor.net).

The opinion comes from having spent the past year configuring and maintaining a few applications on CoreOS/Docker, working through the various kinks, and watching them evolve.

This Docker image is not meant to be used on its own, but instead should be used as a base image that uses the tools in this image to package application specific configuration.
